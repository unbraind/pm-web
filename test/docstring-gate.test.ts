/**
 * Behavioral coverage for this package's docstring gate launcher.
 *
 * The gate's RULES are not tested here. They live in the canonical analyzer
 * published as `pm-ops/docstrings`, together with a defeat-attempt suite
 * covering the ways a docstring can look present without being one. Re-asserting
 * those here would duplicate a suite that already exists and would drift from it.
 *
 * What this file proves is what the launcher itself adds: that it scans THIS
 * package by default and reports it as fully documented, that an undocumented
 * declaration is reported actionably and exits non-zero, that a clean scan exits
 * zero, and that the entry-point guard does not silently skip the gate.
