/**
 * Convergence tests for the publish-attestation gate.
 *
 * This repository no longer implements the gate; it consumes the canonical
 * auditor from `pm-ops/attestation`. So these tests deliberately do NOT
 * re-test the shell model - that suite lives with the implementation, where a
 * fix reaches every consumer at once. What they assert instead is that this
 * repository is still a consumer: that the gate resolves to the package export
 * rather than to a local copy, and that it still refuses an unattested publish
 * through that resolved path.
 *
 * The first is the one that matters over time. Fifteen fail-open constructions
 * have been found in this gate, three of them introduced by the fix for an
 * earlier one, and a copy frozen at any point in that sequence still admits
 * every construction closed after it. A hand-edit that re-forks the lineage
 * would otherwise be invisible.
