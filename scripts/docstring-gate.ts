/**
 * Enforce meaningful docstrings across pm-web source declarations.
 *
 * Thin launcher over the canonical analyzer published as `pm-ops/docstrings`,
 * so the fleet enforces one lexer-backed policy rather than a vendored copy per
 * repository. Every rule lives in the analyzer: every exported declaration,
 * every public member of an exported class, and every substantial private
 * function needs a JSDoc block that contributes information beyond its
 * identifier. This file only chooses the root, maps the report onto the process
 * streams, and sets the exit code.
 *
 * The analyzer has no ignore list and treats unknown declaration forms as
 * violations, so a new syntax form fails closed rather than passing vacuously,
 * and its defeat-attempt suite lives with the analyzer where the policy is
 * implemented.
 *
 * @example
 * ```bash
 * node scripts/docstring-gate.ts          # scan this package
 * node scripts/docstring-gate.ts ../other # scan another repository root
 * ```

 * Whether this module is the process entry point rather than a test import.
 *
 * Both sides are canonicalised through `realpathSync` before comparison. A
 * launcher reaching this file through a symlink (an npm bin shim, a linked
 * workspace) would otherwise compare unequal and skip the gate silently.
 *
 * Resolving only `argv[1]` would be enough under Node's defaults, where the
 * ESM loader realpaths a module before recording `import.meta.url`. It is not
 * enough under `--preserve-symlinks`/`--preserve-symlinks-main`, which leave
 * `moduleUrl` holding the symlink while `realpathSync(entry)` resolves it.
 * The two would then compare unequal on a direct invocation and the gate would
 * exit 0 without scanning — the exact silent skip this function exists to
 * prevent, reintroduced by a runtime flag. Canonicalising both sides adds a
 * second `realpathSync` and removes the dependence on how Node was launched.
 *
 * An unresolvable `argv[1]` **propagates** rather than returning false. The two
 * outcomes are not equally safe: returning false means `npm run docstring`
 * exits 0 having scanned nothing, which is a required release check reporting
 * success without doing its job — the one failure this gate exists to prevent.
 * Letting `realpathSync` throw turns that into a loud non-zero exit. The case
 * requires `argv[1]` to stop resolving after Node has already loaded this file,
 * so in practice it means the environment is broken, and a broken environment
 * must not silently satisfy a gate.
 *
 * A genuinely different entry path still returns false, which is how a test
 * importing this module declines to run the gate.
 *
 * @param argv - The process argv to inspect.
 * @param moduleUrl - The `import.meta.url` of the module that might be main.
 * @returns True when `argv[1]` and `moduleUrl` canonicalise to the same path,
 *          false when they canonicalise to different ones.
 * @throws Whatever `realpathSync` throws when either path cannot be resolved.
