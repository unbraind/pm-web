/**
 * Refuse a release whose `npm publish` would run without `--provenance`.
 *
 * Thin launcher over the canonical auditor published as `pm-ops/attestation`,
 * so the fleet enforces one shell model rather than a vendored copy per
 * repository. That distinction is not stylistic. This gate decides whether an
 * artefact may reach the registry, so a *false pass* is the failure that
 * matters, and the canonical implementation has had fifteen separate fail-open
 * constructions found and closed in it - three of them introduced by the fix
 * for an earlier one. A copy of this file frozen at any point in that sequence
 * is a copy that still admits every construction closed after it.
 *
 * Every rule lives in the auditor: which files GitHub Actions executes as
 * shell, how YAML block scalars are dedented and folded before bash sees them,
 * how a scalar binding becomes visible or stops being visible across
 * conditional arms, and what counts as a publish. This file only chooses the
 * root, maps the report onto the process streams, and sets the exit code.
 *

 * Deliberately carries no shebang. The auditor reads a shebang naming a SHELL
 * interpreter as saying the file's body is shell, so `#!/bin/bash` or
 * `#!/usr/bin/env sh` pulls this file into its own scan - and its prose, which
 * necessarily names the command it is guarding, then reads as an unattested
 * invocation. A shebang naming a non-shell interpreter does not: a shebang says
 * a file executes, it does not say it executes AS shell, so `#!/usr/bin/env node`
 * leaves this file unscanned. The suite ASSERTS the outcome for six shebang
 * cases - five interpreter forms and the absence of one - by running each
 * through the auditor, rather than restating the rule here, because two
 * earlier wordings of this paragraph each stated a rule the auditor does not
 * have. The vendored predecessor had no shebang for the same reason.
