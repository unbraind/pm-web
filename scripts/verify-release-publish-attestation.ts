/**
 * Proves this package has no publish path that omits `--provenance`.
 *
 * The release step used to fall back to `npm publish` without the flag after
 * three failed provenance attempts, reporting success and leaving only a
 * warning annotation. That makes a transient registry failure downgrade the
 * published artifact's supply-chain attestation permanently for that version,
 * and consumers cannot tell such a publish apart from one that never had
 * provenance at all. An unattested publish is not a degraded success; it is a
 * different artifact.
 *
 * A workflow edit is easy to make and easy to lose, so the contract is executed
 * rather than assumed: every `npm publish` this repository can run is found and
 * required to carry the flag. The analysis is separated from the I/O so the
 * rules are driven by the suite against fixtures rather than only against this
 * repository, which happens to satisfy them.
