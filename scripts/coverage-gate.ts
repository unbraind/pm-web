/**
 * Coverage gate for the package test suite.
 *
 * Runs `node --test` with the runtime's built-in V8 coverage against the
 * TypeScript sources directly (Node executes `.ts` natively, so the reported
 * line numbers are the ones an author edits, not compiled output), enforces a
 * per-dimension threshold, and reconciles the reported file list against the
 * files actually on disk.
 *
 * That last step is the reason this script exists rather than a bare
 * `node --test --test-coverage-lines=...` invocation. Node only reports files
 * that were loaded during the run: a source module with no test at all is
 * omitted from the report entirely rather than reported at zero. The published
 * percentage is therefore computed over the tested subset, and a package can
 * satisfy a 100% threshold while an entire module goes unexercised. Comparing
 * the report against a directory walk turns that silent omission into a failure
 * naming the missing files, so the threshold cannot be passed by narrowing what
 * the suite touches.
 *
 * Configuration lives in `package.json` under `coverageGate` so the numbers the
 * gate enforces are visible in the same file that declares the scripts, and a
 * threshold change shows up in review as a deliberate diff.
 *
 * @example
 * ```bash
 * node scripts/coverage-gate.ts
 * ```
