/**
 * npm `prepare` hook that registers pm's field-aware Git merge drivers.
 *
 * Git never clones `.git/config`, so every clone must register the drivers
 * `.gitattributes` declares. The installer lives in the devDependency pm-ops,
 * which an `npm install --omit=dev` checkout does not have. This launcher
 * therefore imports nothing from pm-ops: it resolves the installer entry from
 * the package root and runs it in a child process. Only a missing pm-ops package skips, with one
 * notice; any other resolution failure (for example a pm-ops too old to export
 * the entry, or a `pm-ops` directory whose package.json is gone) and any
 * installer failure fail the install.
 *
 * Canonical copy: `pm-ops/templates/prepare-merge-driver.ts`. Copy it
 * unchanged to `scripts/prepare-merge-driver.ts`.
